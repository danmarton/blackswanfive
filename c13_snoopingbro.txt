Chapter 13: Snooping Brother
-----------

- Come on, answer! God damn it...
- Rinzler!
- It's Nube! We got a problem, sir! The zone...
- Nube, I'm watching the footage on the station. Sorry, I had to go talk to Dr Kessler...
- What did he say?
- Nothing good. I'll tell you later. Did you guys manage to find out anything about the explosion?
- Looks like I was right! SigInt found traces of the rogue AI coming from an old Russian channel. It was re-basing from the zone...
- Dear God, this is getting really nasty! Could you interrupt the re-base?
- Nope. The guys were too late.
- What was the destination?
- Err... Sir, you're not gonna like this.
- Come on!
- It's Colony 5.
- What? Blacklight? God, no...

- Hello, Anubis!
- Jade? What the...?
- I'm standing behind your chair, right-hand man!

White noise...
