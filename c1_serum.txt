Chapter 1: The Serum of Love
----------

"Hey Nube, this is your beloved Imperatrix here! We just arrived at the apartment and now we are enjoying that splendid view from the balcony you told me about, it really is fantastic! Thank you so much for everything and errr... Well, I'm signing off for a few hours and I think you could use a bit of rest as well. Good night, sweetheart!" - she finished the transmission and the cigarette, standing six feet tall in her unapologetic femme fatale posture while gazing at the fluffy clouds over the Pacific ocean. "So", she suddenly turned to me with a deep sigh of reassured comfort, taking off her tight-fitting black combat suit with voluptuous moves before getting on top of me with a quick feline jump.

- Mission accomplished!

Had the Republicans been somehow able to sample that voice, they could have sold the whole Iraq invasion in solid blue states without a single fiasco. The way she was pushing my whole body down with overwhelming muscular power as if she had to incapacitate me for a kiss, it was really fascinating. I had to pull myself together for a barely audible "yeah". I was thinking about my strong desire not to think about anything, like Buddhist monks or whatever. But then of course Imperatrix would find a way to prevent me even if I were the young & charming Mr Siddharta myself, so it's not like even that would matter. It's not like I was able to actually properly think of anything that happened to me during that day which would have been the longest in my life even if it had been ten times shorter, but then I could neither not think of anything. Especially not Jade. Like I said, she was very good at being thought of.

- So... Can I go now?- I tried to laugh for that, but she didn't seem to get it.
- What??? - she pitched up her voice with a twisted look of malign suspicion on her beautiful Semitic face. She was sitting on my pelvis, pushing my chest with her right arm.

Slap!

Now these were not really painful, but they were all the more surprising & humiliating. She must have learned it somewhere. Getting used to those slaps was still Mission Unaccomplished at the end of the weeklong honeymoon we managed to spend together after this night. They seemed to come on the most improbable occasions.

Well, at least one of us was laughing!

- That frightened look of yours is getting ever sweeter! - she reassured me with a passionate kiss and a self-confident smile that would bring hardened consumers of BDSM flicks dangerously close to premature ejaculation. To me it was not the big deal after being woken up last night by a forceful kick on my ribs, only to get pushed back down by her long & strong legs and hear the epic "Fall asleep again and you'll be next!" from behind the barrel of a gun - a scene that felt all the less funny & clich√©-laden from the inside, after actually seeing the gruesome fates of those hapless dudes she did manage to kill or beat unconscious or scare to dementia during the day. Trust me, it was very motivating! She knows how to motivate. I had to guess she was referring to that guy in her squad she executed at point blank for complaining too much. She said the guy was a traitor. She pulled my hands down on her waist, slowly rubbing my penis as she whispered "No, sweetheart, you're not gonna get away from me anytime soon!" into my ears and gave me those sweet kisses all over the place.

- Besides, where exactly would you go anyway?
- Never mind! I was just...
- No, I'm curious! What's your plan B? - she asked back in a voice that was anything but curious.
- Fuck you, Jade!

Slap!

- No, that's plan A! - she laughed again. Sweet, sweet kissing!

- It's hard to imagine you as a mass murderer... - I mused on as I tried to kiss & caress her body as tenderly as possible, trying to turn her a bit nicer on me. Those twenty gruelling years she spent under the strong and rather pushy wings of the black swans were indeed visible on her athletic body adorned with scars & tattoos, but still she was luscious & curvy. Her face was rounded and impossibly cute, her hair was thick and wavy, her eyes were big and genuinely curious. Even her social behaviour was often pretty much like that of a typical Jewish hipster girl from a big city. She loved to be incredibly nice & playful right after being incredibly cruel & savage.

- Well, it's hard to imagine you as a loser who lives with his mom... - she retorted rather quickly. No reassuring arguments about her not being the genocidal type - Come on, you really should take that as a compliment!
- Yeah, thanks! - I muttered. Well, anyways: time to confess! - You know... I mean I was stupid with that joke because... I mean... I think... - I kept muttering all the more painfully as she was not even looking at me. - Okay, this is stupid!
- It's okay, you don't have to say it! - she replied coldly, looking for something in the room.
- Why? - I asked back feeling perplexed and hurt.
- Because it's not true! - she replied as if she were Roxelana herself in bed with Suleiman.
- What?

Now she did look at me just to let me know I should never ask stupid questions. Slap!

- Come on, stop it!
- Nope. Not a chance! - she held her hand in front of my mouth for me to kiss, and slapped again & again until I complied. Her fingers were unusually long.
- What the hell are you looking for?
- No, honey, you don't! - she fetched a little grey box from her suitcase and put it on the nightstand - I mean how could you love me after all this shit? It's not your fault!
- But...
- But you do love me slapping you, this much I know - she laughed - And that's a good start!
- No! - I said sulkingly.

Slap!

- STOP IT!!!

I tried to push her off, but like always she was faster & stronger. She was just laughing at me and it was really embarrassing. I saw her clenching a pair of stockings into her fist.

- Mouth!
- What? No, wait! No! Please!
- Ssh! Good boy!

The rest of my entreaties were already muffled. Looks like the kiss & caress thing didn't work out this time. She was preventing me with ease from moving any part of my body, let alone getting the stuff out of my mouth. Then she decided to push my wrists with her knees instead, and so she did after a few seconds of wrestling. It was a bit painful, but at least she was not sitting on my face. She reached for the box on the nightstand.

Cuffs! Now this really just started getting ridiculous from the inside too.

- No, - she said as she cuffed my hands to the railings of the bed with ease - you don't quite love me, or at least not as much as I love you!

She stressed out the last three words just in case. Ah, okay, great! Cool. Yeah, good to know! I wonder what would happen if she wouldn't love me...

Just kidding! It's last thing I wanted to know!

- But you will! - she suddenly exclaimed, taking another object out of her little BDSM box.

Syringe? WTF? No! Mother of mercy, no! What the holy fuck is happening? I was groaning for mercy as she pushed the stockings a bit further down...

- This will make you love me! - she smiled mysteriously, holding up the device.

In other words: I'm in deep shit! It didn't check out as the typical "loser guy falls for hot babe" story cuz that rarely involves escaping from a post-apocalyptic laboratory complex guarded by heavily armed fellas wearing gas masks, but still I was not thrilled by the prospect of getting syringed by a girl who killed almost two dozen people in a single day. I was not quite sure if it was what she said it was. Creepy. I remember how happily she she accepted the notion that she's a creepy girl when I told her about the notion that I'm a creepy guy as a gesture of self-deprecation when we first met. She said she likes creepy guys. Oh, boy! Well, at least I managed to beg for a bit of question time. I was quickly learning to appreciate the fresh air in my throat.

- Please! What the hell is that? No! - I inquired first coughing and then sighing deeply.
- It's a bit like those love potions in fairytales, you know! - she answered still very mysteriously.
- Fairytales? The fuck? Well, the problem is that this is no fuckin' fairytale, god damn it! Let me out!

She raised up the stockings and her eyebrows as well.

- Okay! Okay, okay, just... Oh, no! Please!
- No, honey, that's exactly the point! - she answered quite unimpressed, caressing my face like an evil hooker - This is no fairytale, and that's exactly why I'm gonna have to use this.

I saw a bit of sadness in her eyes.

- What? No! You're lying to me! Please, just...

Slap!

- I'm not lying to you! - she cried out with visceral anger - Okay, whatever! I don't care what you think and I don't care what you want. I'm gonna push this into you whether you like it or not.

And then I just saw her turn really sad for the first time since I've known her. Not angry or unsatisfied or whatever, but simply & solemnly sad. I just saw her feeling hopeless & powerless and it was really heart-breaking, but also my last chance to avoid that syringe.

- Please! You don't wanna do this, I can see...
- I have to! - she raised her voice again - Don't get me started...
- What? Why? Why do you have to...?
- I need you to trust me!
- What? I mean... Look, you have to admit this ain't makin' sense! Come on! You're smart, you're pretty, you can get any dude you want without a fuckin syringe!
- God damn it, Daniel, stop being stupid! I didn't bring you all the way here just to get laid!
- Aha. So what's the plan?
- This is the plan! - she said unfalteringly, waving the syringe in her beautiful elongated hands.
- Oh, no...

I saw the pity & regret in her eyes, and then some sadness again. My arms were almost torn off by the handcuffs and she was really moved by my urge to embrace her, but she didn't let me go. She was trying to pull herself together with deep sighs and headshakes.

- Okay, look! The thing is that I really need you to trust me and... I mean unconditionally & everything, if you know what I mean, and I need it now. I would find another way if only I could, believe me, but there's no other way! We don't have time for that shit! May I just remind you that the whole Okhrana is up in arms looking for us as we speak?
- Okhrana? Jade, what the fuck are you talking about?
- Okay, never mind! Russian secret service. They have been...
- They have been disbanded a fuckin century ago, for Christ's sake! - I started yelling - Maybe you should stop telling me bullshit if you want me to trust you!

Funny how she didn't bat an eyelid at a whole squad of heavily armed muscleheads pointing big guns at her face, but she jolted up whenever I started shouting arguments. I felt so proud of myself!

- Oh, God! - she sighed with a facepalm after looking at me in disbelief as if the whole Russian revolution were nothing but some crackpot theory in my delusional mind - Okay, look! This is a very long story and there's no point in telling you because you won't remember after the serum anyway.
- What? You're going to...? No, wait! Question! Please!
- Go ahead! - she sighed impatiently.
- What's the... I mean, what's point of all this? I mean, seriously: I cannot shoot, I cannot fight, I cannot drive, I cannot... Come one, I'm totally useless to you! And now you want to erase my fuckin memory as well? Why?

My voice was gradually raising towards the big "Why?". Syringe down. Okay, good! She came close and started caressing me again. Fair enough. Relaxing.

- You are so wrong... Sweet Daniel, you're not useless! You're so useful! I love you!

That was flattering. Yeah, I'm a stud! She looked at me with a great deal of empathy and that kind of traditional feminine passion that drives every heterosexual man crazy. Kiss!

- Oh, God! Look, I'm already feeling very intensely about you! That serum is going to kill me!
- No, sweetie, it's not gonna kill you! Well, first of all I will train you to do all that stuff you just mentioned. I have trained many people do many things, so it's not gonna be a problem. Second, it's not gonna erase your memory or wash your brain or kill you whatever, okay? These are just temporary effects!

I remembered someone from her squad saying "but you'll feed & train him yourself" in a heated argument with Jade, obviously referring to me.

- Temporary?
- Yes!
- So what's the trick?
- Well, it kind of de-constructs your identity if you know what I mean...
- In other words, wash my brain. - I remarked cynically - Okay!
- No! Look, sweetheart, I studied psychology for more than three years and I really know how this serum works. It doesn't work without a very honest & deep connection. It's not gonna wash your brain, okay?

Kiss!

She picked up the syringe very softly. Okay, now it was my turn to cry! Cry, cry, cry...

- It's gonna be okay! - she whispered with the tenderest voice, caressing my face and my chest with the other hand, but that just made me cry further. I was sweating just as well - Can I do it now? Please! Let me just do it, okay?

I was just sighing and crying.

 - Or shall I put the stockings back into your sweet little mouth? - she whispered in a provocative tone.
- Oh, fuck you! - I jolted up - Okay! Okay, just do it! Just do it! Okay...

I lowered my voice as she pushed the needle in. The liquid was colorless & lukewarm. I felt it spread through my veins and I felt a bit of warmth...

- Ah, fuck me! - I sighed with resignation - This better be good...
- It's gonna be okay! - she came back to kiss & caress & hush. I moved on to embrace her as she uncuffed me and we were cuddling & kissing for a few minutes. Nothing special. I was still feeling the same things about her.

- Now what? - I asked impatiently.
- Just wait! - she replied with another sweet kiss before putting the stuff away.
- Shit!

She reached for my hand with a patient smile, and we went to the bathroom where she washed my body with motherly attention and I washed hers.

- It's gonna be okay! - she whispered as we were rubbing each other's genitals - You will love me and I'll love you back. You will please me and I'll please you back. I will make you a happy man.

Then the serum started to kick in...
