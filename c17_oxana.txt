Chapter 17: Oxana
-----------

Another creepy morning: I wake up in the same room, but with a different woman. I think I preferred a different room with the same woman. Now I got those "effects" and yet I have to be nice & polite & deal with a female stranger who happens to be in my bed with her head on my shoulder and her arms embracing my body as if we had spent a whole night together making love. Have we? I don't remember a thing. She has long blonde hair and a beautiful Slavic face. She's very conventionally attractive. At least the effects are getting milder, but still it's painful. She wakes up immediately, hushing me with her index finger on my lips. She has long fingernails with bright red polish. Okay, I like that!

- I'm Jade's friend! - she claims with a Russian accent.
- Are you? Might you even know where she is?
- No, sweet, I don't! She go business, you know? She invite me to look after you!

What? Did she hire a Russian playmate to babysit me? So flattering! The absurdity of the situation makes her smile. She keeps kissing & caressing & rubbing just like Jade. I can't do much to resist because I don't want to fight her and she's really seductive. I'm also caressing her to cool her down. It doesn't seem to work. Passionate kiss!

- To look after me?
- Yes! - she affirms proudly - I am very good friend! I am Oxana! I was Lebedev's wife, you know?
- Who's Lebedev?
- Jade not tell you?
- Nope. She's filling me in pretty slowly.
- Then you don't must know! He was very bad man!
- He was? - I ask back stressing the word in past tense - Ah, okay, I get it! Look, honey, I need to talk to Jade and ask for directives! Can you call her for me?
- Directives? - she laughs.
- Whatever! Just call her, okay? I need to talk to her!
- Okay!

Still laughing, she sits up on me to reach the phone. I get to observe her perfect body.

- Lebedev must have been some high-ranking dude!
- Exactly! - she admits, laughing even harder. She seems to have a very simple sense of humour.
- Oxana, you are so beautiful!
- Oh, you are so sweet! Thank you! - she replies gratefully and gives me a kiss. She fetches a glittering luxury smartphone and rings Jade. She raises my right hand up on her perfectly formed big breast, so I raise the other hand myself as a gesture of obedience. She smiles approvingly, removing her hand downwards in order to please herself. The air's getting too hot to breathe. She frolicks a bit with Jade in Russian, saying the word "directive" at least twice. Then she hands over the phone and goes down on me right away...

Fail! I am barely able to say hello before I get blown away by a very powerful orgasm. I am screaming, they are laughing. I try to apologize with some very deep sighs, but that just makes them laugh even more. I feel ashamed.

- It's okay, honey, it's okay! You're not used to this. Look, I just want you to be really super nice & sweet with Oxana! Okay? That's the directive! She had some very rough days and I want you to do everything you can to please her! Is that clear?
- Yes, ma'am!
- Well, then I guess that's it! I'll be back with you by this time tomorrow and we'll do it threesome! She's gonna stay with us for a while, you know...
- Oh! That's... I don't know what to say!
- Well, then don't say anything, just be good to Oxana! Okay? She's the only thing that matters to you right now! I want you to love her as much as you love me! Understood?
- Understood, Jade! I love her as much as... Wow!
- Good boy! I arranged a computer to play some nice lovemaking music that will automatically adjust to your vibes. Is that okay?
- Of course! Thank you so much!
- You're welcome, my dear! Have a very nice day! Goodbye!

She hangs up. Oxana is happy. She might not have been for a long time. She throws the phone away and starts consuming me all the more voraciously. The serum seems to have a transitive effect: Jade tells me to love her and now I'm falling in love with a complete stranger for real. Time to please!
