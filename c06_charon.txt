Chapter 6: Charon
----------

Charon sits there cuffed, his face white as snow. He's barely able to whisper.

- Jade... Lansky? S-s-so it is true!

Captain Lansky, on the other hand, was more than able to speak loud & clear.

She was also willing:

- Come on! Don't pretend you didn't know it, you little schmuck!

Jade was the daughter of General Julian Lansky. The general has been kicking Mr Zeroni's ass at the Merchant Committee for a very long time, and so did Jade's mother who happened to have the same surname: Avital Zeroni. It was not a coincidence. Charon was Avital's cousin. She has almost killed him at a garden party in Sevastopol. Little Charon had to be hospitalized for six months.

It's a bit like those Bollywood movies indeed...

- I always wondered... How God can keep such an infernal creature like you alive!

- Well, ask that pedophile pater of yours when you meet in hell, you fuckin' shaygetz!

Charon's parents were known to have converted to Catholicism. Jules & Avital remained true to the heritage.

Slap! The one that actually hurts.

It bleeds! Charon musters all of his remaining strength to fight back.

- You shouln't have fucked that boy, huh? Come on! How was his little cock, huh?

Jade grabs his head with iron hands...

- I fucked him to get to you, you imbecile idiot! And now I'm gonna fuck you as well, just a bit... Differently! - she whispers in the bloody ears, then stands up and continues - Oh! Yeah, well, he was okay. Bit shaggy & slow, but... Sometimes you gotta take what's there, you know! Oh, I'm sure you know!

Charon keeps sighing.

- You merchants! You little worms hiding behind those fancy first names while you are spoiling the whole Commune with your blight! I swear to God I'm gonna raze that whorehouse committee to the ground when my father is released from Svalbard! I'm gonna burn you guys alive!

- Your father...

- You know what? I'm gonna torture your sweet little son just like I'm gonna torture you now! And I'll get you a fuckin big plasma screen in your cell so you'll be able to watch...

- Your father will never be released from Svalbard, you stupid bitch! He's gonna rot there in the arctic cold for the rest of his fuckin life, and you know that! Oh, don't you know that, honey?

- I'll find a way to get him out just as I found a way to get the witness here, don't you worry!

- Oh, yeah? Tell me, did you fuck that witness too?

- Come on, don't be silly! - Jade laughs - I was already fucking him just a few hours after the last time I fucked Reaver. Although I would hardly call that a fuck since I was mostly thinking about the way to properly kill him before that sweet innocent boy finds out... Yeah, I keep him on a very tight leash so you guys will never get your filthy hands on him!

- Well, wait until he finds out that you're not even human! - he did his best to shout.
- Relax, Charon! It's gonna be way too late by the time he finds out. He's not stupid, but he's not that smart either.
- You're evil, Jade! There's nothing but pure evil inside that synthetic body of yours!

Jade yawns.

- If only your bastard father hadn't drunk enough to fuck that bitch...

The dagger falls straight on the middle of Charon's right hand. She pulled it out of the sheath and landed the blade into the arteries in less than 50 milliseconds.

- Don't you dare to take my mother on your filthy mouth, you little piece of swine shit!

Charon wets his pants.

- Oh, come on! Stop that! You really are too stupid to go the toilet before interrogation!

Slap! More blood from his ears. Charon stops shouting.

- The bastards didn't let me!

- Well, it's not your lucky day then!

She tilts the chair forwards a bit, pivoting it on the front legs, and moves quickly into position for the strike. The stiletto heel pierces right through the middle of the man's prostate.
