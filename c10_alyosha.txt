Chapter 10: Alyosha
-----------

- Hi there, sweetie! Time to make that phone call, don't you think?
- Oh, Jade! Come here, darlin'! Just come...

Jade strips herself of the combat suit with voluptous moves.

Quick Feline Jump

Stockings
Cuffs
Syringe

All inside that little grey box. Just this time, the serum has got some self-replicating poison nanobots as its payload. They're gonna slowly chew up the dude's body from the inside and then quickly evaporate. She moves with ease.

Cuffs on. Deep kiss...

- Okay, here's the phone!

Kiss!

- No, Jade! Please, just tell me...
- I love you, Alyosha!

Passionate kissing...
