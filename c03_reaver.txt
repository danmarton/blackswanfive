Chapter 3: Reaver
----------

- Look, Sergei, we're in trouble! Reaver's dead.
- No, Charon. You're in trouble. That's none of my...
- She's got his gear! The files, the contacts, everything!
- None of my business, my dear friend! Thanks, we can handle that without your help. We have more than enough problems without yours. Besides, how do you know it was her? Didn't she die like three years ago?
- One more stupid question like that and I swear I'll blow the whistle on you at the Prikaz!
- Oh, please entertain me! I can only wonder how you could find such an idiot for the job.
- Well, you know how hard it is to to find a mole among the black swans! Besides...
- Look, we're out of this! You are on your own, Charon! Like I said, they caused us enough trouble...
- Well, I'm gonna cause a hell of a lot more if you don't help me! You have to get me out of here!
- Ha! I got simpler ways to keep your mouth shut.
- Don't you threaten me, Sergei! Don't you dare to threaten me!
- Or else?
- Look, I know a lot of people at ExCom! I can find another mole in no time.
- Another one like Reaver? No, thanks!
