Chapter 7: The Portal
----------

- Rinzler!
- Hey, it's Nube! I think I found a way to segment the radio signals going through the portal. We can get in touch with the witness's family & the authorities!
- Good work, son! I'll let Jade know as soon as she finishes with Charon!
- Sweet Jesus, I wanted a ticket for that!
- Oh! Now you do believe in Jesus, huh? - Rinzler laughs.
- Fuckin A, colonel!
- Oh, yeah! Hey, what about that CP-event or watcha guys call it? Have you managed to figure out how she got through & back with that guy? She ain't gonna tell me, that's bloody sure!
- Well, me neither! I'm still trying figure out how she got into & out of the zone in the first place, man! Maybe she's gonna tell the witness some stories when they get high, I'll listen in carefully!
- I don't know! The guy's not stupid & she knows that, while in a way he's kind of like totally stupid and she knows that too. His ability to keep secrets, for example...
- Umm... Yeah, that's true!
- Besides, she has already found your backdoor in her gear. It's just a matter of time before she's gonna patch it and you ain't gonna listen to a fuckin thing but white noise!
- I know, I know! Somehow, if we could just... I don't know, whatever! I won't be able to figure it out, colonel! She's always gonna be smarter than me!
- And me! Relax, sergeant, it's easy to be smarter & stronger with all those mods!
- Yeah... Maybe she's colluding with some rogue AI's operating inside the zone, I don't know!
- Might just be the case, son! We'd better watch out for the young bitch!
- Yeah, I'll watch out! Okay, see ya!
- Good night!
