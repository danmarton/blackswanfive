Chapter 4: Merchants
----------

- Rinzler!
- It's Jade. You wanted to talk to me. Did you find the contact?
- Yep.
- Good. Well, bring him...
- He's dead. Fortunately though, we found the handler too.
- Who is it?
- Charon Zeroni.
- Charon? Fuck that slimebag! I should have killed him when I had the chance...
- Shoulda, coulda, woulda...
- Merchants again! Anything new under the sun?
- Sergei's hitmen were already beating him to a pulp when we found him in the basement of a Brothel in Jersey.
- Too bad. Well, treat his wounds and book him a trip to Quito! I want a chit-chat!
- What's up with the witness? I wanna talk to him!
- He's sleeping. Get Charon's ass over here & I'll let you.
- Sounds like a deal.
- Okay, bye! Call me when his plane lands!
