Chapter 5: Home Alone
----------

Painful it was indeed. First came denial: shouting her sweet & eloquently simple name in vain. Then the rest of the five - some theory about terminal patients going through five phases before passing away. It was used by Zizek in one of his new bestsellers called Living in the End Times. There I was indeed. Poetic justice for the loser who lives with his mom.

Heart rate going up. Climbing, climbing...

Oh my God, she's there! Bang! Wardrobe. No, she's there! No, that's Trotsky. Not cool.

Plasma screen? No! Jade!

Please! Pray the lord my soul to take...

Swoon.

Come on, Mistress, kick those ribs! Make it hurt!

Loud music waking me up & there she was!

On the screen. Shit!

- Hello, sweetie, I had to go hit the town for an hour, please forgive me! I'll get back to you as soon as I can, okay? - she was wearing a skimpy black dress with a huge cleavage and some very sodomite boots with stiletto heels made of shining steel. Lucid red lips, long eyelashes, wild make-up. Long dark hair, deep blue eyes. Ha! Take that, douchebags! I'm dating with a Marvel supervillain!

Only problem: she was not there anymore. I wanted to die.

- Why Trotsky?
- In the meantime you can drink that glass of red wine on the table, it's gonna help you with the... Effects.

She sobs for a second.

- Why Trot...?
- Oh God, I'm so sorry! Okay, please drink the wine and then you can get some snacks from the fridge! Just be a good boy for me, okay? Watch some TV, you can turn it on at the lower right side! It's good for you! Okay, ciao!

She drops me a kiss and the screen turns off. I saw a stain of blood on her right hand. Guess the phrase "hit the town" had a more literal meaning in this case.

Okay, drink the wine!

Task 1 completed: Drink the wine!

Woozy. Hmm. Okay, whatever. Let's check out the balcony and grab some fresh air!

Suddenly, Jade's voice:

- No railings, honey! Remember? Please don't do anything stupid cuz I do have some other serums left! Stuff you don't wanna try...

Oh, my God! The serum! Yes! I mean no! Shit! Boy, you are in trouble! Bad boy!

Wine!

Okay, whatever!

- Oh, and please don't touch that Trotsky picture! I don't know what's your fuckin problem with Trotsky...

No, I like Trotsky! What's up with that frame?

Bright flash
Convulsions
Swoon
