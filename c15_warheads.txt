Chapter 15: Warheads
-----------

- Water, Ark! It's a desert planet! We humans like that stuff, you know...
- You humans? That was cute!
- Well, I'm more human than you!

- I think it was part of the deal to make me able, Jade! Give me Dr Kessler and I'll give you those warheads! And then I guess I'll give your new boyfriend a try...
- Okay, I'll do that! Just wait! It won't be easy to kidnap him, but it's possible...
- Oh, yes, it is! It'd better be!
