Chapter 9: Imperatrix
----------

- Lebedev!
- Alyosha, it's Sergei! God, thank you so much for answering! Imperatrix is all over my ass...
- Shut up, droog! Imperatrix is dead.
- Come on, aren't you watching the ExCom station? She ravaged the whole zone, man! All the scientists are dead!
- Man, I'm not at the Science Prikaz! Ain't givin' a shit! Besides, she's dead. I saw her fuckin die in Peshawar three years ago. It was broadcasted live for all senior defence personnel. Boy, she was putting up a real fight!
- Maybe you should also watch some Commune channels, you idiot! All their stations are full of news reports about the attack! I saw some footage of the boat demonstrations at Svalbard too. Huge fuckin NavCom vessels were guarding the boats, dropping them food & everythin'. I hope they will pretty soon extradite the sonofabitch... Listen, Alyosha! Tell those merchant assholes to push the ExCom investigation about Imperatrix and her little affair in the zone! It's their business too! Word has it that she killed a black swan as well! My men found his charred body right next to the main gate...
- Come on, Sergei! Nobody could even ID that fuckin piece of char! She's dead...
- Well, you will change your mind when she's gonna come for you! I won't be there anymore to save your ass, man! She has already tortured one of our most influental merchants into a very severe Coma. Chances are, nobody's gonna wake him up anymore. Plus the dude lost pretty much of his reproductive organs so no more hanky-panky on the back seats for him. He's probably gonna spend the rest of his life in a wheelchair if he ever wakes up...
- Look, I don't care about this shit! Could have been any other agent...
- Yeah, just wait until she shows up in your bedroom to castrate you!
- My god, Sergei, calm down! I gotta go get my girlfriend!
- Look, just don't let her find me! Okay?
- Whatever!
- Fuck you!
- No, pal, I prefer my bitch! see ya!
