Chapter 19: Kabbalat Shabbat
-----------

Turns out, Jade was a neurologist! She used to be a very highly esteemed resident doctor at a very prestigious public clinic on the Venice of the North until her faked death, after which she had to serve in Budapest incognito. She managed to build a splendid little empire in the misty underworld of her world's version of the city I came from. That's how she found me with the help of ARK37, the rogue software agent of the Russian secret service with whom she was chit-chatting about warheads & kidnappings on the phone while I was pleasing her from below. The clever AI girl was discharged from SGB shortly after secretly befriending the enemy's clever AI girl (i.e. Jade's sexy modified brain linked to a vast quantum computing network), so she had to pack her core modules & take refuge in a supposedly derelict research institute. That's where she found the portal, surrounded by a bunch of imprisoned scientists and heavily armed muscleheads wearing protective suits & gas masks against the radiation. The scientists were supposed to get killed by it.

They were killed much more quickly by Jade, and so were the muscleheads. All of them. I was the only natural human person still alive after seeing the zone for real. That's why I was called the witness, although I was still not remembering jack shit. The operation was secretly agreed upon by some very high-ranking Russian honchos led by Alexey Lebedev, except for one small detail: they wanted Jade to keep three members of the spetsnaz team alive & hand me over so those could have taken me to Moscow for interrogation. ExCom agreed, but they couldn't force Jade to undertake the prisoner exchange because she had other plans to release her father, and some very dark & byzantinely sinister scheme with me that was motivated a lot less by love than she kept saying. She really did love me big time, but she never even considered to regard me as an equal partner in our marriage. She was a lot more enchanted by the immense unearthly power she intended to grab with those pretty hands by using me. After all, she was called Imperatrix by all her enemies & many of her friends for a reason. But that's a story for later days!

Spoiler: she's not gonna kill me! Like I said, I'm a real stud...

Jade was waiting for the day of her father's re-instatement which happened shortly after the dude was eloped from that extradition plane, with the help of a general election throughout the Commune that happened between the two events. It was a historic landslide for the Communist coalition: they managed to gather more than two thirds of all seats in the General Assembly after gathering the absolute majority of the popular vote. The name of the electoral alliance was a bit tautological regarding the name of their country, but still they made it. The electoral system was brilliantly democratic, but ARK37 still gamed it like hopscotch. Jade was also sentenced very harshly (i.e. to death) in absentia, so the Communists had to achieve her re-instatement too. Back in Leningrad, however, she did manage to give a shot of her famous love serum to Oxana Lebedeva, n√©e Kristeva. Not with stockings & handcuffs, but still. It was easy for her to lay one of her pretty long hands on the ExCom stock as the stuff was just rolled out for field agents back then. She managed to convince Colonel Rinzler to start a strategic operation, since after all it was the Strategic Operations Committee - that is to say, the joint one. It was called that way to reflect its cross-functional nature, although other explanations were colloquially known as well. We smoked a lot more of that perfetto expensive shit.

Anyway, Jade was already implanting memories into this small mind of mine during the early days of our honeymoon. Turns out, she only needed like two hours of sleep a day. Many humans like to claim that as well, but they are mostly lying: they are either sleeping more or they are cracking up after a few months. Jade, on the other hand, was not cracking up in any sense. That's how she managed to do so many things in her life, aside from other skills like Rapid Reading & Krav Maga. By the time we made it to the ceremony, I already knew how to dance in several different styles and I knew the choruses of a few Kellee Maize songs as well. I fell in love with that woman on YouTube a few years ago, but of course I couldn't remember her lyrics. Well, now I could! Turns out, Jade knew all the lyrics of all her songs by heart. She was singing them for half an hour in the synagogue that night. Her political creed is a polar opposite in many ways, but the Princess of Pittsburgh is nonetheless among her favourite musicians.

The background music was brilliantly re-orchestrated by a very sophisticated semi-automatic synthesizer operated by her brother Anubis, with ARK37 helping out through a secret connection somewhere on the machine's MLF protocol stack. She was playing the lovemaking music as well, which was indeed very nice. She was watching us 24/7 and her new name was Celine. It was very fitting, or at least much more than Avtomatichesky Razvedyvatelny Klaster. Jade & Nube used to do a very fancy musical project together with two of their cousins for a few years. They performed some other songs as well, including 'Seven Lives' from the charming German EBM group In Strict Confidence. The rest of their repertoire was stuff I didn't know. Their music is very similar to ours, but it's always more unapologetic & synthetic, and the melodies tend to be more complex. Genres barely surviving on the fringes of my world are insanely popular in theirs while those held in the highest regard by the philistine members of my world's middle class are mostly banished to reactionary countries and nursing homes, often by the government itself. To those hopelessly retarded ageing rocker fellas lamenting the death of music, it's a lot more dead over here - and so are they.

The rabbi was a nerdy young man named Amon Sandberg. He's a radical reconstructionist with an ardent faith in the messianic role of human modification, often brought to court by foreign diplomats for supporting terrorism - a charge he likes to dismiss with a cynical shrug as a bunch of reactionary bollocks. The passion that motivated him to study the faith of his parents was originally a will to destroy the community as a rebellious teenager, but later he came to the conclusion that Communism & Transhumanism are at the very heart of God's plan for mankind. Despite the fact that he knew more about Judaism than all the chief rabbis of the world combined, no one was willing to ordain him until Jade's father decided to employ him outside the official rabbinical framework. He was mostly responsible for the spiritual & political education of junior agents.

Oxana was quite a gifted singer in her mother tongue as well, so she sang a few of her favourite songs too. She used to visit some very posh night clubs in the communard districts of Moscow. That was hidden from her past by a black swan sting op. I helped out at Kellee's songs wearing a sexy junior agent uniform. Back in the morning, I signed some contract with a little blood sample and some very finely detailed QR hash code made from the features of my face & voice & stuff like that, i.e. my biometric features.

I was a corporal. First class! Later on, I was quickly promoted to sergeant. I was on par with Nube, although one must note that the guy was not taking his army career very seriously. His mom, on the other hand, looked really fuckin' hot! She really was a woman of timeless beauty like Isabel Allende or Fayrouz. She was always wearing mind-blowingly sexy long dresses of which she had at least a thousand, with lots of jewelry & make-up. She had a beautiful little piece of jade hanging on a thin golden necklace.

- Damn, I would totally fuck her! - I told Jade absent-mindedly.
- You will! - she replied all the more seriously, with cold serenity in her voice.
- Oh, I'm sorry! I didn't mean to... - I tried to apolozige.
- No, it's not your choice! You'd better make yourself comfortable with the idea...

Avital gave me a seductive smile that made me almost faint while talking to her friends in the distance. She didn't say a word to me that night, but we kept eyeing each other all the time.

- But not tonight, honey! - Jade turned my head back towards herself for a sweet kiss.
