Chapter 11: Extradition
-----------

Prominent Russian defense ministry official Alexey Lebedev was found dead in the penthouse suite of a luxury hotel in Moscow. Rumor says it that Mr Lebedev had an extramarital affair...

- Rinzler!
- Hey, my sweet colonel! You watchin' the station?
- Jade? What the hell did you do again?
- Alyosha! - she laughed frivolously, saying the name with genuine Russian accent.

I woke up in a different room, but she was right there & that's all what mattered. I could smell the sweet fragrance of her hair as she was resting her head on my chest, caressing my body as she talked on the phone. I trust Jade! I will always trust & love her with all my heart. Her very presence makes me feel instantly safe. No questions, no worries. She kept speaking Russian all the way through that Lavan Institute building complex as well. The whole area was full of radiation, so she gave me some special clothes & pills to survive. That's where she killed that Reaver guy, right behind the main gates. The poor Russian fella was looking really hot indeed. If only she hadn't fallen for the black widow of Leningrad, a whole life of joy would have awaited him among the black swans. Jade was probably the most notorious party girl in the city which belongs to the Commune just like Helsinki. She gave the guy that stupid nickname - probably for a reason. His parents were some alcoholic immigrants.

Alyosha was also doing diplomatic service in Leningrad for a while.

- Wow! You're movin' pretty fast indeed.
- He made the phone call.
- Good girl! Wow, I see his corpse on the screen... Now that looks gruesome!
- They're gonna extradite Dad next friday. Justice Minister Fedorov is gonna hold a press conference in a few minutes. They seem to be pretty pissed off for the sudden tragic loss of their lovely handsome SGB princeling. Except for his wife Oxana, of course. I'll have to get her out of Russia...
- Sergei must be shit scared by now!
- Yeah, I made him call his droog too. That was two hours after the injection. So, err... Prepare Black Swan 3 for me, will you? I'm gonna need some DefCom stealth jets too.
- After I talked to the witness! - Rinzler snaps.
- Oh, well... - she sighed - Sounds like a deal! Have you got his contract?
- It's gonna be in your mailbox by this time tomorrow, Jade! Relax!
- Okay, call me when the crew arrives at the fort!
- Whatever! Fine.
- Okay, see ya!
