Chapter 2: Loyalty Check
----------

- Oh, my god! Guess what? I left something in the car! I left... Oh, my god! It's a little grey box, you know? You know that little grey...?
- Yeah! I think...
- Oh, my god! Can you get it for me? Please! I need that box! Can you...?
- Sure! Yeah, I... Where...?
- You know what? You can jump from the balcony and it's right there! Can you do it for me?
- Yeah! Sure.
- Oh, wait! No! Stop! It's here! I'm so sorry, it was right here!
- What...? Ah, okay!
- Come back here, sweetie!
- Sure you don't need...?
- No, just come back here and kiss me!

Kiss!

- Okay...

Kiss! Jade laughs.

- Okay, listen! Don't climb those railings, okay?
- But you just...
- No! Honey, it was just a test! I was just testing you!
- What?
- Never mind! Don't climb those railings, okay? It's not safe!
- Hmmm...
- Promise me!
- What? Ah, no! Okay, no railings! Sure!
- Ssh! Look at me! Look into my eyes! Always look into my eyes, okay?
- Okay!

Kiss!

- Look into my eyes! Just look into...

Kiss!

- Look into my eyes... Listen! Ssh! Just listen! I want you to promise me one thing, okay? Just one!
- Okay!
- Whatever happens, just stay close to me! Alright? Stay close to me! Always stay close to me!
- I will! I love you!
- I love you too! Okay? Just stay... Don't listen to anybody telling you anything, just stay close to me!
- No, I'm not listening... No, just you! Only you! I don't care about others, they can kiss my ass!
- Okay, good! Good boy! - Jade laughs.
- Even if my mom tells me something, I don't care. I don't give a shit! Just you!
- Good!
- Even if I tell me something...

Kiss!

- You're so sweet and I love you so much! Do you know that?
- You do?
- Yes! I love you more than anything I ever had! Do you know that?
- You do? - I start crying a bit. She laughs and kisses my forehead.
- Yes, I do! I love you more than anything! Okay?
- My god, I love you so much! It hurts...
- Ssh!

Kiss!

- I won't let anything happen to you, okay? Whatever happens, always just do what I tell you! Just do what I tell you, okay? I will always protect you, honey, you know that!
- I love you!
- I love you too! You are so precious! Do you know that?
- You think so?
- No, honey, I don't think so! I know. It's a fact.
- Thank you so much!
- You are the most precious thing I will ever have! Do you know that? You're the only thing I have...

- Well, that much is true right now!
- Who was that?
- Anubis, shut the fuck up! Stop bugging me!
- Anubis?
- Ah, you got a serum for me too?
- Fuck you, Nube! Shut the fuck up!
- Rinzler is looking for you. Just sayin'!
- Shut up, just... Okay, fine, I'll talk to him! Anything else?
- Nope!
- Did you find Reaver's contact?
- We're closing in, Jade! Relax!
- Anubis! Who are you?
- Anubis Lansky, sir! Jade's brother & right-hand man, at your service...
- Yada yada! Please just leave us alone, okay?
- Wow! Cool... Wait! Where are you?
- Can't disclose!
- Why not?
- Okay, have a nice day! See you guys!
- Who's Rinzler?
- What an idiot!
- Thanks, Jade! I love you too!
