Chapter 14: What's a good party?
-----------

The smell of ganja wakes me up. Yet another room. Jade is passing the joint to a handsome middle-aged man in a fancy Communist uniform who passes it on to a guy who looks like Aaron Swartz in his later years.

- Wow! What's a good party?
- Oh hi, honey! Good morning! I want you to say hello... No, it's Nube's turn! Take a seat, will you?
- Err... Hi! Are you Jade's brother? - I ask Mr Swartz. Jade rests her hand on my right leg possessively.
- In the flesh!
- So nice to meet you!
- Likewise!
- And you, dear sir? - I ask the Commie guy.
- Eridan Rinzler. I was looking forward to meet you, Daniel! - we shake hands. Cool dude!
- Nice costume you got!
- Oh, thank you so much! - he laughs - Well, I'm mostly doing desk jobs these days. It takes costumes.
- What do you do?
- I'm Jade's boss.
- You mean you used to be until your boss decided to declare me a dead person! I'm mostly freelancing since that time...

Nube pokes me. Oh, it's my turn! Overdue!

- Ah, this is good shit!
- It's the best shit - Nube replies like a real ganxta.
- You grew it?
- No, I'm not a farmer - he laughs.
- Is it legal here?
- Yes! - Jade replies quickly to avoid any confusion - Absolutely! You can get an ounce for fifty dollars in any supermarket. One strong pillar of the Commune's stability indeed. God bless!
- Wow! That's like seven times cheaper than at home!
- Your home must be a pretty fucked-up place - Nube remarks - Aren't the people rioting & shit?
- It is! - Jade re-inforces - They are.
- Yeah - I acknowledge sadly - So, err... You guys like Trotsky?

Awkward silence. They all start laughing.

- What's so fucking funny?
- Never mind... Well, I saw him once or twice as a kid. He was very old, but still impressive. Jade's grandfather...
- Okay, wait! Wait! If I may ask, sir, how old are you?
- Forty-nine. Why?
- I'm sorry, sir, but it doesn't check out. Trotsky died more than seventy years ago!
- In your world, yes - Rinzler replies completely unfazed - In ours, he died in 1971.

Awkward silence. Nobody starts laughing. Too bad!

- Hmm! Errr... What the fuck?
- Well... - Rinzler starts, but I raise up my finger to ask for a bit more silence.
- Okay, wait! Let me just... Okay, so err... That's supposed to mean we... I mean I, err... Just came to a... Parallel universe, that's it! I mean...
- Well, it's something like that - Rinzler replies still completely unfazed.
- Aha!

More silence. Jade is standing. She tries to say something, but I don't give myself so easily!

- Wait! Is this some kind of reality show?
- What? - the two men both ask back. Now if anything, this should convince you about the merits of Socialism! Jade, however, finds it funny.
- Now that would be a nice way to pimp you indeed, but I think I got some better plans for now. No, honey, this is not your Truman show! This is as real as me fucking you on that bed... - she ends with a lower voice & a frivolous smile, leaning down at me to give a soft kiss on the lips while pointing at the double bed.
- Ah, that was way too hot to be real! - I talk back with my well-rehearsed PUA smile.

She laughs! Ten points to the witness! Rinzler is amused, but Nube is growing a bit impatient.

- I stand corrected! - she replies smiling voluptuously, with a great deal of self-esteem - But let's not try the patience of these brave men, so let's just assume it's not! Okay? Besides, if it were, then maybe you would actually remember how you got here! Am I right?

Like always, she was right. Mysterious smile!

- Hmm, you might just have a point... No, I can't remember jack shit! Was that in the small print?

She smiles & bites her lips, pointing at the amused Mr Rinzler & the impatient Mr Lansky.

- Okay, parallel universe! Whatever! So, errr... Tell me something funny about this world of yours!

- Well, that's just what I wanted to do! - Jade sets off with a deep sigh and turns the large plasma screen on. I see a map of the world with vast areas and lots of smaller patches painted red. According to the legend at the lower right, it means "Commune territories". The title at the top says "The Commune" as well, right next to a big red star between the letters C and I.

Nice!
