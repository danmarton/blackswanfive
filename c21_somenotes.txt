Chapter 21: Some Notes
-----------

HI ITS JADE
FOUND UR MEMOIR @ LAST :)
ITS REALLY SWEET

SOME NOTES IF U DONT MIND:

- Daniel the Kingslayer has been doing all my dirty work for 20 years. Now he "retired" (i.e. resigned with a severance package we're gonna spend on Colony 5 #jk) in order to apply for a different position. He's not gonna retire anytime soon. He was made to serve me!
- Yet I still "jolt up" whenever he's "shouting arguments", and that's not something I do to a great many people. I do treat him as an equal person whenever he deserves to be treated as such.
- He spent 15 months on Svalbard for killing President Kachinsky, though he was released by a judge instead of Black Swan 3. My son Tyrion was conceived inside the int'l prison.
- He killed another Viktor, namely his beloved prime minister, with the same rifle. It was not a Dragunov.
- He served on the Khalisi for more than 2 years after that hitch-hike. It's a very special vessel with a million capabilities!
- He was still a regular agent when these things happened. He served only one term as a general exec.
- We have two other men in the family named Daniel. We are not reactionaries, for God's sake! Fortunately though, those guys do have middle names as well.
- That "killing since the age of six" story is a bit more complicated.
- The Antonov dropship was basically his idea. Indeed he said it while asleep in Shay's bed, but Celine liked it and she proved him right with some calculations. Antonov is one pretty big aerospace company of these "human realms", so it's hardly a surprise. They built the Novalis tanker as well.
- I take anywhere between 20 to 300 minutes of sleep a day on average, but quite often I get none. Same goes for Daniel, though we really had to stuff his brain with quite a bunch of mods & memories to achieve that.
- He's got a dozen "bastard" children like Tamir Lemberg, Chantal Zeroni, Milla Kristeva (the 5th element of JSOC), Anton Lavan & a handful of Lanskys: Eamon, Eris, Elessar, Yehuda, Lydia, etc. Yes, the names! I know. Arwen wanted to name hers Viserys cuz she was in love with Harry Lloyd, but I threatened to kill her so she named him after Tolkien's big hero. I always wondered why she didn't fuck Mr Lloyd instead? I only wanted 2 kids cuz I'm so selfish! LoL
- Isis is my daughter. She was four when Daniel first met her.
- Everyone who marries a Lansky girl has to take our name unless he's a disgrace to the family.
- Sleeping with my mom was very much his choice too. He was totally into her!
- We let mom keep her surname as a reminder for the Zeronis (and the world) that their best & brightest child is actually on our side.
- Celine has a human ID: Celine Lavan. Yes, she's Anton's mom & she used to be ARK37.
- LoL, I'm not luscious & curvy! I could ill afford that as a field officer of ExCom, though these days I'm a president of the Commune, but still I got small tits.
- Daniel might have a legion of women, but we also have legions of men. All the girls, especially Celine!
- I hooked up with Daniel thru OkCupid on December the 12th of 2012. We were both 27. The invasion started only two years later, but the "strange things" started happening on the very next day. The conspiracist idiots did an excellent job portraying them, but let me leave this for him to tell! He's the witness after all...

!!! LOVE U !!!
