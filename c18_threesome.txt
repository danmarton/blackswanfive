Chapter 18: Threesome
-----------

So, Jade wanted us to watch some Game of Thrones! I kid you not. She knows I haven't seen a single episode. I used to take some pride in that for a while. As it turned out, her family was often portrayed by many critics (including Jade herself) as a feudal dynasty. They were very rich & powerful indeed, plus they were quite a bunch of people with many of those "fancy first names" like Cygnus or Isis. The latter I found suiting for its owner who did have a rather short temper by the time I first met her large & happy family. These days she serves among the black swans with so many of her relatives, but the family has a strong foot in other committees as well. Among the merchants, for example, they are a crucial driving force behind the Red Star Alliance: a group of commercial companies living up to the highest expectations to represent those "values & interests" of the Commune.

If you want to put the Lanskys somewhere on a map, you should look for Sandy Hook. It's right on the other side of the Lower Bay when you look out from Sea Gate. It used to be an old army base called Fort Hancock, but nowadays it's mostly called Fort Lansky instead. That's the central base of the JSOC. By the way, Jade's granddad was the first general executive of ExCom in the early fifties when it was formally established. He was re-elected for three consecutive terms - the father of the Commune's secret service, so to speak. He used to be one of Trotsky's young disciples after winning some writing contest, growing up to become his right-hand man after marrying one of his daughters. The name of his "house" was given to him as a moniker by Lev Davidovich himself, for his short temper (inherited among others by the young Isis) and wayward romanticism (inherited among others by the Casanova of Sevastopol, General Julian Lansky) - obviously referring to Onegin's tragically fallen rival. His original name was Anatoly Rosenbaum, but he came to be known by the world only as the dreaded general executive Anthony Lansky. I met him once or twice, although he was permanently tied to a computer already. Like I wrote in previous chapters, Jade was a captain until her presumed death and his brother Anubis was a sergeant. A strong family it was!

Anyway, Fort Lansky is where the crew of Black Swan 3 has arrived that morning when I woke up with Oxana. It was led by Colonel Shaylene Lemberg. She told me all this Lansky story after Jade introduced us to each other. She just dropped by for a tea, fixing the details of tomorrow's main event with Jade. She was ten years older than the young Miss Lansky whose grandfather, Mr Rosenbaum, was also hailing from Lviv - otherwise known as Leopolis aka Lemberg. Shaylene had her dinasty as well. It was a bit smaller & less powerful, but it was very tightly interconnected with the Lansky house. Jade's dad was cheating her mom with that lady for many years. That's why Agent Zeroni decided to move abroad with her septennial cyborg daughter when she found out. She said she needed some fresh air away from the fort. Like I said, Shay was ten years older - already in her age of consent. She's still one of Jade's best friends and on very good terms with Avital as well. Funny stories these are! Jade & her mom were not officially seen for ten years, although the former husband kept handing them very lucrative ExCom contracts.

Tomorrow evening, we are expected to attend a Kabbalat Shabbat ceremony. We are, at least according to what she says, somewhere in South Brooklyn. It's an ExCom safehouse - the kind of room with a Trotsky picture that flashes and makes you swoon after a few convulsions if you move too close. It's bit like the telescreen, as Jade later mentioned on one of those "threesome" nights. Now you trust me there: making love with two Communist alpha females under a Trotsky telescreen is an experience of a lifetime! Let's just hope we won't check out room 101...

Oxana wants to practice her English because she wants to "serve the Commune", as it came out of her very enthusiastically. The two girls met & fell in love back in Leningrad while the pretty Russian lady was already married to Mr Lebedev. She was at least five years older, but Jade was nonetheless her role model in many ways. Aside from herself, the lover kept delivering nice & handsome well-educated losers like me under the radar of the SGB, colloquially known as the Okhrana. They did it threesome with many other guys before me. Oxana believed the world is fundamentally unjust in every respect, so she was only interested in rebellious intellectual losers. That's probably what other women of her age would call incredibly childish, but it's not like she ever gave a fuck. If they have been unlucky with women as well, all the better! She loved those who could talk about things she didn't understand while falling for her "conventional" beauty nonetheless. Needless to say, she loved Game of Thrones...

- Where is this show come from? - the adulterous trophy wife asks with unquenchable curiosity. We are watching the Starks & Lannisters quarrel endlessly with Russian subs.

- From a parallel...
- Warner! It's new.

Whatever! Pardon me for the unwanted candor, young Daenerys... No, that must be Oxana for sure! She's blonde, with a bit larger tits, and a total pothead by the way. She was nagging me all the time for the joints Jade kept rolling. The stuff we smoked was actually a lot more expensive than the stuff you get in the supermarket, so it's not like the whole Commune is simply a stoner's paradise or anything. Somewhat disturbingly, Jade kept laughing out at the most brutal scenes (featuring either bloodshed or prostitutes, or both) that gave the series its wildly popular naturalistic edge. She said they were funny because they portrayed evil as something super exciting and grandiose, while in reality it was always pretty boring and banal.

- You think so?
- I don't think so! I know!
- Indeed. Actually, you are absolutely right. I like that!
- Honey, I'm always absolutely right! - she laughs.
- No, I mean scientifically! Hannah Arendt has written a whole book about this.
- Well, I don't know that girl, but I think I could do it just as well. Trust me, honey, I should know! Those noblemen, for example, they should be way too scared of STD's to fuck around just like that...
- Well, that's an interesting point!
- In any case, at least it's better than Tolkien. Please, just tell me you don't like Tolkien!
- I used to like him as a teenager.
- Well, do you like him now?
- I don't. I think he's kind of boring and he's blatantly reactionary as well.
- That's my boy!
- Yes! It's totally boring! - Oxana agrees laughingly.
- You guys know Tolkien?
- We do. He was already a grown-up man when the divergence happened.
- The what?
- Never mind! I'll tell you later.
- I mean Tolkien is also better in a certain way because it really is pure fantasy.
- No, sweetheart, it's pure bullshit! - she laughs.
- I mean I'm not entirely sure if I like all that grim stuff in fantasy fiction. I think the whole thing should be an anti-thesis of the real world so I can chill out while reading. What do you think?
- Well, I think you're being a bit silly here. Tolkien depicts a world strictly divided into good guys and bad guys, and that's stupid. I think even fairytales should get over that level of thinking. Oh, and the good guys, for some reason, they always just happen to be Conservative as fuck. It's all bullshit!
- Okay, you're right! I mean... But Harry Potter is cool, and it's also about good guys vs bad guys.
- Yes, but the good guys are not Conservative. In fact, they are quite progressive. And the whole setting is modern, which makes the story a lot less stiff & formal.
- Harry Potter? - we seeemed to be losing Oxana.
- Okay, divergence! I'm so sorry!
- It's okay. But we're not gonna watch Harry Potter here, if you don't mind - she gives me a sitcom smile.
- I think I can manage - I sitcom-smile back.

I was so proud of her!
